A Rotating puzzle game

Richmond Hill High School ICS4UE-02 Final Project, 2012-2013 second semester.

Authors: Sherman Ying (github.com/spectrastorm) and Austin Tripp.

Requires overhaul of graphical interface which apparently is too dark to use easily. Also needs re-thinking on the control interface which should have 4 movement directions, 2 rotation directions, and 1 tile activation button. Text could be improved, was created as a placeholder but due to time constraints was not changed.
